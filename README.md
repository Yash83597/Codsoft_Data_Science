# CodSoft_DataScience_Internship_Tasks_by_Yash_Chauhan
Here is collection of work from my data science internship! You may discover a few of the projects I worked on during my internship at Codsoft in this repository. My abilities in data analysis, and machine learning are demonstrated in each project. An overview of the projects is given below:
1.	Titanic Survival Detection Project:
•	The goal of this project is to predict passenger survival by analyzing the Titanic dataset. It includes activities data preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to forecast survival probabilities.
2.	Sales Prediction using Python Project:
•	The goal of this project is to forecast a company's sales. Preprocessing data, exploratory data analysis, and creating a predictive model to project future sales are all included.
3.	Credit Card Fraud Detection Project:
•	The creation of a model based on machine learning intended to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project uses logistic regression for efficient classification, preprocesses the data, and tackles class imbalance.
